    		  		  	<p>This project was a lot of fun, it was a mock portfolio. It was fun working on figuring out how to code each section and to make sure the links brought you to the right section of the site. I learned how to create spacing with margins and padding as well as how to embed social media links. This site taught me the importance of UI/UX. Making sure the links are easy to find and easy to use is so important to build a strong online prescence, and this project really drove that home for me. Check out the link and let me know what you think. *^_^*</p> <a href="https://nmunoz0923.github.io/jubilee-austen/">https://nmunoz0923.github.io/jubilee-austen/</a>

    		  	<p><span>This project was for a travelling food truck that brings you fresh ideas in food. I learned alot about the importance of playing with the code. I made several revisions to my code to create borders on this one, and that gave me get a greater understanding of how my code was being interpreted by the browser. I got to test on different browsers to ensure the site works properly on them. This also helped me expand my knowledge working with placement of more div's because different things happen when you view site on different browsers.

    				<p><span>Hi I'm Natasha Munoz and I'm learning how to code!</span><br></p>
                    <p> After graduating and feeling unfulfilled, I decided I wanted to have a career with more creative freedom, challenge, and more opportunity for growth... So, I signed up for classes with SkillCrush Coding School, where I'm getting hands-on experience designing and creating sites online. I've developed different projects through the curriculum, that have given me the skills necessary to start a career as a free-lance Developer, or work for a corporation full-time. <br> <br> So far, I've learned how to build sites using HTML, CSS, Photoshop, and I can't wait to learn more! I'm so proud of the progress I've made so far, developing sites has really helped me expand my knowledge and gain more coding experience. I love Web Development because it allows me to use my creative thinking to help other people share their passion with the world!</p>
